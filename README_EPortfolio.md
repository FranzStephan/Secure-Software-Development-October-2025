# Secure Software Development E-Portfolio

This e-portfolio documents my progress throughout the Secure Software Development module at the University of Essex Online (October 2025 Cohort). It includes reflections, diagrams, practical work, reading notes, and evidence of collaboration and skill development.

---

## Module Focus

This module explores:

• Secure software architecture  
• Identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities  
• OWASP Top 10 risks  
• Secure coding and design principles  
• Practical GitHub portfolio creation

The e-portfolio shows both academic and hands-on learning progress.

## Unit 1: Introduction and Secure Software Design

### Overview of Learning Focus

Unit 1 introduced secure software development concepts and how poor design decisions can introduce vulnerabilities early in the lifecycle. We reviewed core security principles, explored UML behaviour modelling, and examined key OWASP Top 10 risks affecting web applications.

Security must be planned from the beginning of a project by clearly defining authentication, authorisation, and data control rules before implementation.

### Secure UML Modelling Task (Discussion Activity)

As part of the discussion activity, I created a UML Activity Diagram that demonstrates a **Broken Access Control** vulnerability. In this flawed scenario, a system successfully authenticates the user but fails to enforce authorisation, allowing access to protected information.

In my initial post, I explained the vulnerability and recommended UML models for secure design. I also provided peer responses, suggesting improvements to classmates regarding validation placement and threat prevention.

### Reading and Learning Completed

• Buelta (2022) on architecture patterns and modular design  
• Velepucha and Flores (2023) on microservices design challenges  
• ISO/IEC 27000 Section 3 terminology on access control and accountability  
• OWASP Top 10 2021 guidance on major security failure categories  
• Lecturecast content introducing UML for secure design

These sources helped strengthen my understanding of secure system flows and how system boundaries must be enforced at the design stage.

---

### Group Project Work (Team WAECHTER)

I contributed to early planning:

• Brainstorming initial approach to our secure application  
• Listing required security-critical components  
• Task splitting and planning communication  
• Mapping connections to OWASP and ISO requirements  
• Agreement to begin UML modelling in Unit 2

---

### Reflection: What I Learned

This unit taught me that secure systems fail when authentication and authorisation are confused. A user may authenticate successfully but still have no right to certain information.

UML modelling helped reveal exactly where checks must happen. This visual method is useful to identify risks early. I also learned how to use GitHub for publishing academic evidence. It was slightly confusing at first, but I am now comfortable uploading and editing files.

Unit 1 established a strong foundation for secure software engineering and prepared me for continued architectural development in later units.
